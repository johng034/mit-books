# MIT Press Essential Knowledge series.

I came across the MIT Essential Knowledge series in a bookstore at Venice Beach. The store only have a few of the books from the complete series, and every single topic interested me. After considering each book, I decided to purchase *Post-Truth* by *Lee McIntyre*

The book was an enjoyable read, and it made me curious to find out the full selection of books. I find myself visiting the main website quite frequently, so I thought I should write a script to scrape the data for me.

## Data Collected
For each book in the series, I collected the: 
- Title
- Author(s) 
- Author(s)' website
- Link to the book
- Link to purchase the book
- Publish date
- Book length (number of pages)
- Price

## Webscaping Tools
The packages used for webscaping were `bs4` and `requests`

## Saved Data
The saved data can be found in the `saved_data` folder. There is an Excel file and a csv file.
