# MIT Press Essential Knowledge series.

I came across the MIT Essential Knowledge series in a bookstore at Venice Beach. They had a small collection, yet it seemed like all the avaiable book topics grabbed my attention. After considering each one, I decided to purchase *Post-Truth* by *Lee McIntyre*

The book was an interesting read, and it made me curious to find out the full selection of books. I find myself visiting the main website quite frequently, so I thought I should write a script to scrape the data for me.

The packages used for webscaping were `bs4` and `requests`

## Saved Data
The saved data can be found in the `saved_data` folder. There is an Excel file and a csv file.
